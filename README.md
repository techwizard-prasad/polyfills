# Polyfills

A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.

In this repository, I have created polyfills of some basic javascript functions as mentioned below

1. Array.prototype.forEach
2. Array.prototype.map
3. Array.prototype.filter
4. Array.prototype.reduce
5. Array.prototype.flat
6. Function.prototype.call
7. Function.prototype.apply
8. Function.prototype.bind
9. lodash.cloneDeep

Polyfill is also a wellknown interview question, so feel free to go through the code. You can create a pull request if you feel you can contribute further in the repository.
You can see the code for each of them in `/src`` folder.

To run the code, run `npm run dev` > Select which polyfill you want to run by entering respective number
